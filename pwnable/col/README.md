What the program does is taking your input (that have to be 20 bytes length) and than change it to integer.
After that the program calculating the sum of the five integers ( each one is 4 bytes ), and compare it to the hash code.
The solution for this level is taking the hashcode and divide it by five, and than pass the result as argument.
